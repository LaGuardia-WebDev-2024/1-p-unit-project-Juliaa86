        <h3> What are they </h3> 
            <ul> 
                <li> <b> Dance </b>is the rhythmic movement of the human body, often to music, used for creative expression, storytelling, social connection, or religious purposes. It is an art form characterized by structured or improvised sequences of movements, incorporating elements like body movement, space, time, and energy to convey ideas, emotions, or symbolic meaning.  </li>
            <li> <b>Aerial</b> Apparatuses: Dancers use various equipment suspended from the ceiling, including:
Aerial Silks: A long piece of fabric for climbing, wrapping, and creating shapes. 
Aerial Hoop (Lyra): A circular steel apparatus for acrobatics. 
Trapeze: A bar suspended by ropes or straps. 
Aerial Sling/Hammock: A fabric swing that functions like a hammock. 
Fusion of Art and Fitness: Aerial dance is both a performance art and a demanding fitness program that builds strength and flexibility. 
Verticality: The use of suspended equipment adds a vertical dimension to dance, allowing for movements like climbs, spins, drops, and flips that are impossible on the ground. 
Creativity: Dancers weave choreography into the apparatus, creating their own sequences and expressing themselves through movement.  </li>
<li> <b> Stage Managment </b> focus on both the core technical duties (scheduling, calling cues, managing stage elements) and essential soft skills (communication, organization, leadership, problem-solving). Use a combination of methods including lectures, practical exercises like analyzing scripts and creating shift plans, and real-world observation. Supplement with resources such as stage management handbooks, online tutorials, and the opportunity to practice with a mentor or more experienced stage manager. </li>            
</ul>
